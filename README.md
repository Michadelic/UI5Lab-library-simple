UI5Lab-library-simple extended with a sample browser

> The repository is a fork of [UI5Lab-library-simple](https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab-library-simple) with additional metadata and a browser for samples that reads the metadata to display samples from one or more libraries
 
## TODOs and ideas
* refactor index.json so that the relevant parts are located inside each library (ideally most data is implicit and can be generated by the next bullet)
* create a simple (nodejs) service that finds all libraries and samples currently available and returns a json with all relevant information
** Alternative: put static json data at root level and wait for UI5 tooling to do this for us
* put the browser in a separate project with a dependency on sap.m and sap.f and load it as a dependency in a library project
* browser needs sap.f but library does not, how to deal with nested dependencies?
* library project should simply consume the browser dependency to show all samples currently available in the workspace

## Getting started

1. Install node.js (get it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)).
 * If working behind a proxy, you need to configure it properly (HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY / NO_PROXY environment variables)

2. Clone the repository and navigate into it
```sh
git clone https://github.com/openui5/UI5Lab-library-simple
cd UI5Lab-library-simple
```
3. Install all npm dependencies (also installs all bower dependencies)
```sh
npm install
```

4. Run npm start to lint, build and run a local server (have a look into `Gruntfile.js` to see all the tasks).
```sh
npm start
```

5. Open a test page in your browser: [http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/geometry/Square.html](http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/geometry/Square.html)

### Directions

[Browser](http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/browser/index.html) A sample browser showcasing artifacts from one or more libraries

[Control page](http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/geometry/Square.html) An HTML test page instantiating the control

[Test page](http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/geometry/qunit/Square.qunit.html) A simple QUnit test

[Testuite](http://localhost:8080/test-resources/ui5lab/geometry/qunit/testsuite.qunit.html) A QUnit testsuite running all unit tests in this library
